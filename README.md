# Classification Model Development

In this project I am using the information from my course to build a predictive model on a binary response variable (Y-variable) from a Game of Thrones Dataset. This project encompasses feature engineering, model preparation, variable selection, and model development.

## Model Types Used

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors Classification (KNN)
- Classification Trees
- Random Forest (Classification)
- Gradient Boosted Models (GBM)
